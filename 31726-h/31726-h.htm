<h2><a name="HEINRICH_HEINE" id="HEINRICH_HEINE"></a>HEINRICH HEINE.</h2>
<h3>(BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.)</h3>


<p>Harry Heine, as he was originally named, was born
in D&uuml;sseldorf on the Rhine, December 13th, 1799. His
father was a well-to-do Jewish merchant; and his mother,
the daughter of the famous physician and Aulic Counlor
Von Geldern, was, according to her son, a "<i>femme
distingu&eacute;e</i>." His early childhood fell in the days of the
occupation of D&uuml;sseldorf by the French revolutionary
troops; and, in the opinion of his biographer Strodtmann,
the influence of the French rule, thus brought directly to
bear upon the formation of his character, can scarcely
be exaggerated. His education was begun at the Franciscan
monastery of the Jesuits at D&uuml;sseldorf, where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
teachers were mostly French priests; and his religious instruction
was at the same time carried on in a private
Jewish school. His principal companions were Jewish
children, and he was brought up with a rigid adherence
to the Hebrew faith. Thus in the very seed-time of his
mental development were simultaneously sown the germs
of that Gallic liveliness and mobility which pre-eminently
distinguish him among German authors, and also of his
ineradicable sympathy with things Jewish, and his inveterate
antagonism to the principles and results of
Christianity.</p>

<p>As the medical profession was in those days the only
one open to Jews in Germany, the boy Heine was destined
for a commercial career; and in 1815 his father
took him to Frankfort to establish him in a banking-house.
But a brief trial proved that he was utterly unsuited
to the situation, and after two months he was back
again in D&uuml;sseldorf. Three years later he went to Hamburg,
and made another attempt to adopt a mercantile
pursuit under the auspices of his uncle, the wealthy
banker Solomon Heine. The millionaire, however, was
very soon convinced that the "fool of a boy" would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
never be fit for a counting-house, and declared himself
willing to furnish his nephew with the means for a three
years, course at the university, in order to obtain a doctor's
degree and practice law in Hamburg. It was well-known
that this would necessitate Harry's adoption of
Christianity; but his proselytism did not strike those
whom it most nearly concerned in the same way as it has
impressed the world. So far from this being the case,
he wrote in 1823 to his friend Moser: "Here the question
of baptism enters; none of my family is opposed to
it except myself; but this <i>myself</i> is of a peculiar nature.
With my mode of thinking, you can imagine that the
mere act of baptism is indifferent to me; that even symbolically
I do not consider it of any importance, and that
I shall only dedicate myself more entirely to upholding
the rights of my unhappy brethren. But, nevertheless,
I find it beneath my dignity and a taint upon my honor,
to allow myself to be baptized in order to hold office in
Prussia. I understand very well the Psalmist's words:
'Good God, give me my daily bread, that I may not
blaspheme thy name!'"</p>

<p>The uncle's offer was accepted. In 1819 Harry Heine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
entered the university of Bonn. During his stay in
Hamburg began his unrequited passion for a cousin who
lived in that city&mdash;a passion which inspired a large portion
of his poetry, and indeed gave the keynote to his
whole tone and spirit. He sings so many different versions
of the same story of disappointment, that it is impossible
to ascertain, with all his frank and passionate
confidences, the true course of the affair. After a few
months at Bonn, he removed to the university of G&ouml;ttingen,
which he left in 1822 for Berlin. There is no
other period in the poet's career on which it is so pleasant
to linger as on the two years of his residence in the
Prussian capital. In his first prose work, the <i>Letters
from Berlin</i>, published in the <i>Rhenish-Westphalian Indicator</i>,
he has painted a vivid picture of the life and
gayety of the city during its most brilliant season. "At
the last rout I was particularly gay, I was so beside myself,
that I really do not know why I did not walk on
my head. If my most mortal enemy had crossed my
path, I should have said to him, To-morrow we will kill
each other, but to-night I will cordially cover you with
kisses. <i>Tu es beau, tu es charmant! Tu es l'objet de ma</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
<i>flamme je t'adore, ma belle!</i> these were the words my lips
repeated instinctively a hundred times; and I pressed
everybody's hand, and I took off my hat gracefully to
everybody, and all the men returned my civilities. Only
one German youth played the boor, and railed against
what he called my aping the manners of the foreign
Babylon; and growled out in his old Teutonic, beer-drinking
bass voice, 'At a <i>cherman</i> masquerade, a <i>Cherman</i>
should speak <i>Cherman</i>.' Oh German youth! how
thy words strike me as not only silly, but almost blasphemous
at such moments, when my soul lovingly embraces
the entire universe, when I would fain joyfully embrace
Russians and Turks, and throw myself in tears on the
breast of my brother the enslaved African!"</p>

<p>The doors of the most delightful, intellectual society
of Germany were opened to the handsome young poet,
who is described in a contemporary sketch as "beardless,
blonde and pale, without any prominent feature in his
face, but of so peculiar a stamp that he attracted the attention
at once, and was not readily forgotten."</p>

<p>The daughter of Elise von Hohenhausen, the translator
of Byron, has given us a charming sketch of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
mother's Thursday evening receptions, which Heine
regularly attended, and where he read aloud the unpublished
manuscripts of his <i>Lyrical Intermezzo</i>, and his tragidies,
<i>Almansor</i> and <i>Ratcliffe</i>. "He was obliged to submit,"
writes Mlle. von Hohenhausen, "to many a harsh criticism,
to much severe censure; above all, he was subjected
to a great deal of chaffing about his poetic sentimentality,
which a few years later awakened so warm a
response in the hearts of German youth. The poem, ending,
<i>Zu deinen s&uuml;ssen F&uuml;ssen</i> ('At thy sweet feet'), met
with such laughing opposition, that he omitted it from
the published edition. Opinions of his talents were various;
a small minority had any suspicion of his future
undisputed poetical fame. Elise von Hohenhausen, who
gave him the name of the German Byron, met with many
contradictions. This recognition, however, assured her an
imperishable gratitude on Heine's part."</p>

<p>Not only his social and intellectual faculties found
abundant stimulus in this bracing atmosphere, but his
moral convictions were directed and strengthened by the
philosophy and personal influence of Hegel, and his
sympathies with his own race were aroused to enthusiastic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
activity by the intelligent Jews who were at that
time laboring in Berlin for the advancement of their oppressed
brethren. In 1819 had been formed the "Society
for the Culture and Improvement of the Jews,"
which, though centered in Berlin, counted members all
over Prussia, as well as in Vienna, Copenhagen, and New
York. Heine joined it in 1822, and became one of its
most influential members. In the educational establishment
of the <i>Verein</i>, he gave for several months three
hours of historical instruction a week. He frankly confessed
that he, the "born enemy of all positive religions,"
was no enthusiast for the Hebrew faith, but he was none
the less eager to proclaim himself an enthusiast for the
rights of the Jews and their civil equality.</p>

<p>During his brief visit to Frankfort, he had had personal
experience of the degrading conditions to which
his people were subjected.</p>

<p>The contrast between his choice of residence for
twenty-five years in Paris, and the tenacity with which
Goethe clung to his home, is not as strongly marked as
the contrast between the relative positions in Frankfort
of these two men. Goethe, the grandson of the honored
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
chief-magistrate, surrounded in his cheerful burgher-life,
as Carlyle says, by "kind plenty, secure affection, manifold
excitement and instruction," might well cherish
golden memories of his native city. For him, the gloomy
<i>Judengasse</i>, which he occasionally passed, where "squalid,
painful Hebrews were banished to scour old clothes," was
but a dark spot that only heightened the prevailing
brightness of the picture. But to this wretched by-way
was relegated that other beauty-enamored, artist-soul,
Heine, when he dared set foot in the imperial Free
Town. Here must he be locked in like a wild beast,
with his miserable brethren every Sunday afternoon. And
if the restrictions were a little less barbarous in other
parts of Germany, yet how shall we characterize a
national policy which closed to such a man as Heine
every career that could give free play to his genius, and
offered him the choice between money changing and
medicine?</p>

<p>It was not till he had exhausted every means of endeavoring
to secure a remission of the humiliating decree
that he consented to the public act of apostasy, and
was baptized in the summer of 1825 in the Lutheran
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
parsonage of Heiligenstadt with the name of Johann
Christian Heinrich. During the period of his earnest
labors for Judaism, he had buried himself with fervid
zeal in the lore of his race, and had conceived the idea
of a prose-legend, the <i>Rabbi of Bacharach</i>, illustrating the
persecutions of his people during the middle ages. Accounts
vary as to the fate of this work; some affirm that
the manuscript was destroyed in a fire at Hamburg, and
others that the three chapters which the world possesses
are all that were ever completed. Heine, one of the
most subjective of poets, treats this theme in a purely
objective manner. He does not allow himself a word of
comment, much less of condemnation concerning the
outrages he depicts. He paints the scene as an artist,
not as the passionate fellow-sufferer and avenger that he
is. But what subtle eloquence lurks in that restrained
cry of horror and indignation which never breaks forth,
and yet which we feel through every line, gathering itself
up like thunder on the horizon for a terrific outbreak at
the end!</p>

<p>Would that we could hear the explosion burst at last!
We long for it throughout as the climax and the necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
result of the lowering electric influences of the story, and
we lay aside the never-to-be completed fragment with the
oppression of a nightmare. But a note of such tremendous
power as Heine had struck in this romance, required
for its prolonged sustention a singleness of purpose
and an exaltation of belief in its efficacy and truth,
which he no longer possessed after his renunciation of
Judaism. He was no longer at one with himself, for no
sooner was the irrevocable step taken than it was bitterly
repented, not as a recantation of his principles&mdash;for as
such, no one who follows the development of his mind
can regard it,&mdash;but as an unworthy concession to tyrannic
injustice. How sensitive he remained in respect to
the whole question is proved most conspicuously by his
refraining on all occasions from signing his Christian
name, Heinrich. Even his works he caused to appear
under the name of H. Heine, and was once extremely
angry with his publisher for allowing by mistake the full
name to be printed.</p>

<p>The collection of poems in prose and verse known as
the <i>Reisebilder</i>, embraced several years of Heine's literary
activity, and represent widely-varying phases of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
intellectual development. We need only turn to the
volumes themselves to guess how bitter an experience
must have filled the gap between the buoyant stream of
sunny inspiration that ripples through the <i>Harz-Reise</i>,
and the fierce spirit of vindictive malice which prompted
Heine, six years later, to conclude his third and last volume
with his unseemly diatribe against Count Platen.
Notwithstanding their inequalities, the <i>Reisebilder</i> remain
one of the surest props of Heine's fame. So
clear and perfect an utterance is sufficiently rare in all
languages; but it becomes little short of a miracle when,
as in this case, the medium of its transmission is German
prose, a vehicle so bulky and unwieldy that no one before
Heine had dared to enlist it in the service of airy
phantasy, delicate humor and sparkling wit.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1830, while he was loitering at
Helgoland, he was roused to feverish excitement by the
news of the July Revolution. He inveighed against the
nobility in a preface to a pamphlet, called <i>Kahldorf on
the Nobility</i>, which largely increased the number of his
powerful enemies. The literary censorship had long
mutilated his prose writings, besides materially diminishing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
his legitimate income by prohibiting the sale of many
of his works. He now began to fear that his personal
liberty would be restricted as summarily as his literary
activity; and in May, 1831, he took up his residence
in Paris. He perfected himself in the French language,
and by his brilliant essays on French art, German philosophy,
and the Romantic School, soon acquired the
reputation of one of the best prose writers of France, and
the "wittiest Frenchman since Voltaire." He became
deeply interested in the doctrine of St. Simonism, then at
its culminating point in Paris. Its central idea of the
rehabilitation of the flesh, and the sacredness of labor,
found an enthusiastic champion in him who had so long
denounced the impracticable spiritualism of Christianity.
He, the logical clear-headed sceptic in all matters pertaining
to existing systems and creeds, seems possessed
with the credulity of a child in regard to every scheme
of human regeneration, or shall we call it the exaltation
of the Jew, for whom the Messiah has not yet arrived,
but is none the less confidently and hourly expected?
Embittered by repeated disappointments, by his enforced
exile, by a nervous disease which had afflicted him from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
his youth, and was now fast gaining upon him, and by
the impending shadow of actual want, Heine's tone now
assumes a concentrated acridity, and his poetry acquires
a reckless audacity of theme and treatment. His <i>Neue
Lieder</i>, addressed to notorious Parisian women, were
regarded as an insult to decency. In literary merit
many of them vie with the best of his earlier songs;
but the daring defiance of public opinion displayed in
the choice of subject excluded all other criticism than
that of indignation and rebuke. There is but a single
ray to lighten the gathering gloom of Heine's life at this
period. In a letter dated, April 11th, 1835, occurs his
first mention of his <i>liaison</i> with the grisette Mathilde
Crescence Mirat, who afterwards became his wife. This
uneducated, simple-hearted, affectionate child-wife inspired
in the poet, weary of intellectual strife, a love as
tender and constant as it had been sudden and passionate.
A variety of circumstances having combined to reduce
Heine to extreme want, he had recourse to a step
which has been very severely censured. He applied for
and received from the French government a pension
from the fund set aside for "all those who by their zeal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
for the cause of the Revolution had more or less compromised
themselves at home or abroad." Now that the
particulars of the case are so well known, it would be superfluous
to add any words of justification; it can only
excite our sympathy for the haughty poet doomed to drain
so bitter a cup. He was pressed to take the oath of naturalization,
but he had too painful experience of the renunciation
of his birthright ever to consent to a repetition
of his error. He would not forfeit the right to have inscribed
upon his tomb-stone: "Here lies a German poet."</p>

<p>In 1844 his uncle Solomon died; and, as there was no
stipulation in the banker's will that the yearly allowance
hitherto granted to Heinrich should continue, the oldest
heir Karl announced that this would altogether cease.
This very cousin Karl had been nursed by Heine at the
risk of his own life during the cholera-plague of 1832 in
Paris. The grief and excitement caused by his kinsman's
ingratitude fearfully accelerated the progress of the malady
which had long been gaining upon the poet, and
which proved to be a softening of the spinal cord.
One eye was paralyzed, he lost the sense of taste, and
complained that everything he ate was like clay. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
physicians agreed that he had few weeks to live, and he
felt that he was dying, little divining that the agony was
to be prolonged for ten horrible years. It is unnecessary
to dwell upon these years of darkness, in which
Heine, shriveled to the proportions of a child, languished
upon his "mattress-grave" in Paris. His patient
resignation, his indomitable will, his sweetness and
gayety of temper, and his unimpaired vigor and fertility
of intellect, are too fresh in the memory of many living
witnesses, and have been too frequently and recently described
to make it needful here to enlarge upon them.
In the crucial hour he proved no recreant to the convictions
for which he had battled and bled during a lifetime.
Of the report that his illness had materially modified
his religious opinions, he has left a complete and
emphatic denial. "I must expressly contradict the rumor
that I have retreated to the threshold of any sort of
church, or that I have reposed upon its bosom. No!
My religious views and convictions have remained free
from all churchdom; no belfry chime has allured me, no
altar taper has dazzled me. I have trifled with no symbol,
and have not utterly renounced my reason. I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
forsworn nothing&mdash;not even my old pagan-gods, from
whom it is true I have parted, but parted in love and
friendship."</p>

<p>"I am no longer a divine biped," he wrote. "I am
no longer the freest German after Goethe, as Ruge
named me in healthier days. I am no longer the great
hero No. 2, who was compared with the grape-crowned
Dionysius, whilst my colleague No. 1 enjoyed the title of
a Grand Ducal Wlimarian Jupiter. I am no longer a
joyous, somewhat corpulent Hellenist, laughing cheerfully
down upon the melancholy Nazarenes. I am now
a poor fatally-ill Jew, an emaciated picture of woe, an
unhappy man."</p>

<p>Thus side by side flowed on the continuous streams of
that wit and pathos which he poured forth inexhaustibly
to the very end. No word of complaint or impatience
ever passed his lips; on the contrary, with his old, irresistible
humor, his fancy played about his own privations
and sufferings, and tried to alleviate for his devoted wife
and friends the pain of the heart-rending spectacle.
His delicate consideration prompted him to spare his
venerable mother all knowledge of his illness. He wrote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
to her every month in his customary cheerful way; and, in
sending her the latest volumes of his poetry, he caused a
separate copy always to be printed, from which all allusions
to his malady were expunged. "For that matter,"
he said, "that any son could be as wretched and miserable
as I, no mother would believe."</p>

<p>Alas! if he had known how much more eloquent and
noble a refutation his life would afford than his mistaken
passionate response to the imputations of his enemies!
Is this patient martyr the man of whom B&ouml;rne wrote:
"with his sybarite nature, the fall of a rose-leaf can
disturb Heine's slumber. He whom all asperities fatigue,
whom all discords trouble, let such a one neither move
nor think&mdash;let him go to bed and shut his eyes."</p>

<p>Only in his last poems, which were not to be published
till after his death, has Heine given free vent to the bitterness
of his anguish. During the long sleepless night
when he lay writhing with pain or exhausted by previous
paroxysms, his mind, preternaturally clear and vigorous,
conceived the glowing fantasies of the <i>Romancero</i>, or the
Job-like lamentations of the <i>Lazarus</i> poems. This
mental exercise was his protection against insanity: and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
the thought of his cherished wife, he affirmed, was his
only safeguard against the delirious desire to seize the
morphine bottle by his side, and with one draught put
an end to his agony. On the night of the 16th of February,
1856, came the long-craved release&mdash;and on the
20th of February without mass or "Kaddish," according
to his express wish, he was buried in the cemetery of
Montmartre.</p>
